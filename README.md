Symmetric Rangoli Pattern (Python Turtle)

This project generates a colorful, symmetric rangoli (pookalam-style mandala) using Python’s built-in turtle graphics library.
It’s designed to showcase radial symmetry, layers of petals, geometric motifs, and decorative elements—similar to traditional rangoli or kolam designs.

🎨 Features

8-sector central circle with alternating colors (yellow & orange).

Multiple decorative rings: squares, diamonds, stars, petals, and leaf-like motifs.

Intricate mandala details, lotus petals, swirls, and paisley-inspired shapes.

Perfectly symmetrical 8-petal and 8-pointed star arrangements.

A layered center mandala with concentric lotus petals.

Border decorations with colorful dots for a finished look.

🛠️ Requirements

Python 3.x

No external libraries needed (uses only the built-in turtle and math modules).

▶️ How to Run

Save the script as rangoli.py.

Run it in your terminal or IDE:

python rangoli.py


A window will open and render the rangoli design.

Click anywhere inside the turtle graphics window to exit.

📂 File Structure
rangoli.py   # Main script that draws the rangoli pattern
README.md    # Documentation (this file)

🖼️ Output

The script generates a mandala-like rangoli with layered petals, motifs, and vibrant colors.
Think of it as digital art inspired by Indian traditional rangoli and pookalam designs.

🚀 Ideas for Extension

Add user input to customize colors, radius, or number of petals.

Export the drawing to an image file (using turtle.getcanvas().postscript).

Animate the drawing by removing screen.tracer(0) for a “growing rangoli” effect.
